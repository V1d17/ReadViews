***ReadViews***

**Inspiration:** 

This project emerged from my experience relocating to San Francisco, where I found it challenging to find suitable dining options
and relevant information about tourist attractions. I often had to sift through numerous articles and reviews, which was time-consuming
and inefficient.

**Implementation:**

To address this issue, I created Readviews, which extracts essential metadata such as names, locations, prices, and
reviews, and utilizes RAG-based LLM to provide users with precise information based on their queries.
