Everything about this place is great, the views are breathtaking and the hiking trails are plentiful. The park rangers are also really cool and super helpful. They are incredibly sweet and knowledgeable about the park. The park itself is also incredibly clean which is great and even the people who come here are respectful of the park.\n\nJust keep in mind if you do come, there is a limited number of bathrooms, water fountains, benches and similar amenities around the park. It is wise to keep a map of Yosemite with you that shows you where everything is. In addition to this, because the park is out in nature, it may be difficult to get internet connection while here. There were times where my friends and I did not have any connection and needed to resort to the map to figure out where to go.\n\nOne final note: the trash cans and recycle bins are also posted in certain places around the park. They are not everywhere. Even at our campsite, we did need to walk a bit to find the nearest trash can to throw away our things",

Hiked to Mirror Lake, great hike, not too strenuous and quite fun, mostly in the shade.  Fantastic view and very peaceful.  The mirror effect is a true mirror but one can only see it if you get close to the edge of the water.\nYou can also walk around the lake and have a spectacular view of your surroundings from the middle of a meadow.  Breathtaking!\nAlso enjoyed the Curry Village afterwards for food and drinks, not overpriced.  Store has a lot of selection of prepared food and not overly overpriced.\nThere is an ice cream shop in the village that we missed, we had bought some ice cream bars already from the store.  Lots of souvenirs/clothes/last minute camping gear in there.\nMirror Lake is about 1.5-2 miles from the village.",

Yosemite National Park evoked such feelings within us.\n\nWe had the opportunity to visit one of the most magnificent National Parks in the United States: Yosemite National Park, located in the state of California. Spanning 759,620 acres and managed by the National Park Service, Yosemite was designated a World Heritage Site in 1984. It is internationally renowned for its granite cliffs, majestic waterfalls, crystal-clear streams, towering sequoia groves, pristine lakes, rugged mountains, expansive meadows, ancient glaciers, and rich biological diversity.\n\nWe spent an entire day driving and exploring the park, yet it was evident that one day was simply not enough to cover all of its highlights. Yosemite National Park is truly immense, with every corner boasting colossal beauty.\n\nWe just wish we had more time, so we could simply sit beneath the trees and gaze at the granite cliffs that seemed to cast a spell on us.\n\nIt's no surprise that Yosemite has become one of the most sought-after destinations for travelers from around the world. Our time in Yosemite National Park was simply unforgettable, and we're already eager to return.",

Rebirth is evident everywhere you look.  There are awesome trail systems, the most wonderful waterfalls that you can get right up close to, blooming flowers, and wildlife abound.\n\nThe park service has done a good job of preserving the bounty of nature and offering accessibility to people while still meeting the many needs of visitors.  The shuttle system is great when parking is limited.  It takes time but saves miles for tired feet.  The rangers were exceptional at providing good information on appropropriate hikes to meet our wishlist and abilities.\n\nMust sees include:  Glacier Point, Mariposa Grove, Tioga Pass (Olmsted Point and Tenaya Lake), Vernal Falls!  Bridalveil and Yosemite Falls, and Mirror Lake.  There are many secrets to be discovered here...get out...hike, picnic, explore.  Yosemite is a Jewel!

The number of visitors will be limited now from April 2024, which reduces masses and crowded promoting better views. Some people stay here for a day and some come for a day trip from San Francisco.",

Overall it was a wonderful time and a great place to see and observe nature. The night sky is spectacular, and I would highly recommend doing a sky tour. There was a lot of road construction as it is all mountains and one road basically going in and out of some park entrances, keep this in mind as traffic can be bad.",

The valley\u2019s meadows, surrounded by towering cliffs and giant sequoias, offer serene spots for picnicking and photography. For those seeking adventure, the park\u2019s extensive trail system provides hiking opportunities for all levels, from easy strolls to strenuous backcountry treks.\n\nThe park is also a haven for wildlife enthusiasts, with opportunities to see black bears, deer, and a variety of bird species in their natural habitats. Educational programs and ranger-led tours offer deeper insights into the park\u2019s ecology, geology, and history, enriching the visitor experience.\n\nYosemite National Park is well-equipped with amenities to enhance your visit. The park offers a range of accommodation options, from rustic campgrounds to the historic Ahwahnee Hotel. Visitor centers provide maps, information, and exhibits about the park\u2019s natural and cultural heritage.

Lines to enter the park, full parking lots, lines to eat, lines to shop the stores, lines to use the free in park shuttles. The short hiking trails also get busy.

            "review": "Yosemite National Park is not just a park; it's an emblem of nature's grandeur, showcasing awe-inspiring vistas, towering cliffs, ancient giant sequoias, and breathtaking waterfalls. It stands out as one of the most majestic natural wonders in the United States, if not the world.\n\nPros:\n\nScenic Beauty: Yosemite offers iconic views like El Capitan and Half Dome that are unmatched in their majesty.\nDiverse Activities: Whether you\u2019re into hiking, rock climbing, photography, or simply enjoying nature, Yosemite has something for everyone.\nWell-Maintained Facilities: The park is well-maintained with clean restrooms, informative visitor centers, and well-marked trails.\nEducational Programs: Ranger-led tours and educational programs are available, enhancing visitor understanding of the park\u2019s natural and cultural history.\nCons:\n\nCrowding: Popular spots can get crowded, especially during peak tourist seasons (spring and summer), which can detract from the serenity.\nAccommodation Costs: Lodging within the park and nearby can be pricey and books up fast, planning well in advance is recommended.\nExperience:\nVisiting Yosemite is like stepping into a vast painting. From the moment you enter, the landscape captivates with its raw beauty. The park\u2019s highlights like Yosemite Falls\u2014the tallest waterfall in North America\u2014and the serene beauty of the Merced River running through Yosemite Valley, are sights that photos can hardly do justice.\n\nTrails range from easy walks like the one to Mirror Lake, which reflects a stunning image of Half Dome, to more challenging hikes like the ascent to the Upper Yosemite Falls or the infamous Half Dome trek (permit required). The park staff are knowledgeable and genuinely enthusiastic about preserving and sharing the beauty of Yosemite.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nYosemite National Park is a treasure trove of natural beauty that offers a profound reminder of the wonders our planet holds. It's a place that can be visited repeatedly, with each visit revealing new aspects and sensations. Whether you're a seasoned outdoor enthusiast or a family looking for a memorable vacation, Yosemite delivers an experience that is both invigorating and grounding. Don\u2019t miss the chance to witness its beauty firsthand\u2014a true bucket list destination.",

There are no signs whatsoever as you drive towards the falls or back to let you know how many miles you still need to go. People were fighting over parking spots as soon as you would drive through the tunnel due to illegal turns and cutting each other off to get a spot and no rangers were in sight to guide or direct or assist people with these issues. All they care about is just making money and that's it. Their website is terrible because it doesn't even release the dates for reservations when it's supposed to be released.

            "review": "Yosemite National Park is an amazing place to visit. The park is huge but the most popular area is of course The Yosemite Valley and it has to be one of the most stunning places to visit in California. This can get very busy at weekends or holidays so avoid those times if possible. Its not an easy part to get out on your own and away from the crowds but is still worth visiting for hiking or sight seeing. Everything in the valley is well sign posted including the best view points of the sights and the trail head.\n\nFour Mile Trail and Upper Yosemite Falls trail are well worth the effort. They are fairly strenuous so food, water and outdoor clothing should be carried. Upper Yosemite Falls trail is usually accessible all winter due to the fact the sun shines on it for most of the day. Four Mile is the opposite and is usually open upto the snow line until the thaw.\n\nHetch Hetchy is a must and I would recommend the Wapama and Rancheria waterfalls trail. This area is less busy than the valley but can still see large crowds in the summer and holidays. Like always venture more than 100 metres from the car and the crowds soon start to disperse.\n\nToulumne and Merced Redwood groves are worth the short hike. They are less busy than Mariposa Grove as they see less coach groups there.\n\nMarch is a nice time of year if you can avoid the final winter storms. The storms can cause the roads to temporarily close or have tyre chain requirements. A 4x4 is nice for confidence at this time of year but not essential.\n\nThe NPS App is excellent for Yosemite and all you need to know is available there. Also arriving before 0900 at the park entrances is good for beating ques.",

We explored Yosemite Falls, a 7.46-mile hike from the parking lot. Parking can be challenging, so arriving early is advisable.

We got there early so we had good luck with parking but if you come later prepare to utilize the shuttles. We went in July so it was hot! Bring extra water, a poncho, and some walking sticks. Make sure your shoes have good grip as well. Surrounded by granite stone, impossibly tall waterfalls, valleys and vistas, it was a great bucket list item to cross off. The day before we did Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, which I also recommend! Less foot traffic there. We hiked the Mist Trail and the John Muir trail. When we started there weren\u2019t too many people but by the time we were done it was busy. Amazing experience overall. We hiked about 9 miles total that day.",

Unfortunately, the road was not open to driving.  It was a beautiful day, but not quite April.  Which is when I believe the park is fully open.\nAmazing pictures and time basking in the mist of the Bridesvail Fall.\nThe Valley was full of entertainment and interesting displays.

It's a consistent grade though it is steep. Take it to the top for epic views the whole way. If you go panorama then John Muir trail they take you past the Illiouette and Nevada Falls which are incredible (careful near the edge, especially in winter with the black ice about). Epic to see sunrise in Yosemite Valley!",

They had plenty of built in rest stops and plenty of time to explore on your own within the park at each location too. I don't feel that the experience would have been quite as full and complete if we would have just driven it on our own. If you are thinking about taking this trip, don't hesitate! Make this happen!

This is not very environment friendly. Next visit I know it. The park is huge and a lot to see. I spent there 1 day, which is a good time to relax also a bit. There are also shuttle buses, if you have to park too far away. Facillities for food and rest rooms are available.\nI can recommand the hiking path along the river and the yosemite falls. The halfdome I saw from far, but for a photo is was ok.",

I am a sucker for sunsets and the sunsets here are phenomenal. Parking can be a bit challenging due to the crowds so would advise getting to the park early. There are restaurants in the park where you can grab a snack/lunch. We grabbed burger and tenders from the grill at the village and it was delicious.

It is a decently large park and takes 40 min to get to pretty much anywhere you really want to get to. Going around the valley is easy and the roads were not crowded or difficult to navigate when I went. There are mountains, waterfalls, lakes, rivers and even a grove of Sequoia trees.\n\nMight have to grow out my mustache and start carrying my two sidearms because I'm a real Yosemite Sam after my visit!",

            "review": "FIREFALL 2024! I could write about how amazing Yosemite National Park is, but that's been said enough. This is specifically about the sunset phenomenon that happens for 2 weeks every February, known as Firefall. It is increasingly rare, as there hasn't been enough snowpack for Horsetail Fall to flow in recent years. Usually when it is seen, the Firefall is a reflection of a direct sunset, causing a yellow and orange glow on the fall. When I took this photo, 2/13/24, the direct sunset was blocked as thick, low clouds had just moved in. However, there was a cluster of high cirrus clouds, at just the right angle to direct a bright pink light on Horsetail, creating a rare \"Pink Champagne Fall,\" and I recommend anyone who is able to try and see Firefall one day! Yosemite is one of the few National Parks I would say is equally enjoyable in any season!",

From there we went down into the Valley and did hikes around & to places such as Bridalveil Falls, El Capitan, Yosemite Falls, Mirror Lake, Half Dome, Yosemite Valley Lodge and Mariposa Grove.\n\nSouth Entrance give immediate access to Mariposa Grove and is a windy 45 minute drive to the dramatic entrance that is Tunnel View, above Yosemite Valley. From there you can drive down into the valley and begin a series of one-way roads connected by loops throughout. Don't worry if you make a wrong turn...it's never significantly far to loop back around and the scenery makes up for it. Shuttle helps if you want to park and just ride along to whatever stops you choose: there are 18 or 19 shuttle stops, well marked on the map. Yosemite is pristine; absolutley gorgeous. Wildlife all over. We will definitely be back, and could easily spend a week or more here hiking and camping deeper into the park on lesser frequented trails & areas.",

From the sheer face of El Capitan, to the beautiful greenery along the valley floor.\n\nThere are free shuttle buses around the valley, although we didn't use them. There's normally a (paid) bus to and from Glacier Point but this isn't running during 2023.\n\nThe view as you enter the park through the tunnel is stunning. As you drive into the tunnel everything feels close and dark. As you emerge it's suddenly filled with bright light and expansive views. It's one of the most amazing moments.\n\nWe went at the beginning of October. There was ample parking. And the food court wasn't overly busy. At the end of our 9 mile hike we dropped into the Starbucks for hot chocolates and that did have a long wait.\n\nDidn't see any bears sadly.",

Seeing thousands of feet of granite vertically sheared will give you a new perspective as you contemplate the magnitude and force of glacial erosion, and the scale of geologic time, prequired to create the practically vertical walls of Half Dome and El Captain. Say nothing of the incredible climbing talent required to scale those vertical walls, or the amazing ecosystem that has managed to find a foothold up the cliffs.\n\nThere are as many options for lodging in Yosemite as there are ways to explore the park, from tent camping, to heated tent cabins, to the Yosemite Lodge, and the 4-Star historic Ahwahnee Hotel. The earlier you plan your trip, (up to a year in advance) the more options you will have. Summer is very busy, and can be hot, while fall is a very nice time to visit with cooler temperatures. Winter and spring can find the valley coated in snow, and the high sierra access road and pass will be closed.\n\nFood options range as well, from pizza in curry village, to the Mountain House in Yosemite village to the majestic dining room at the Ahwahnee. Reservations for dinning are suggested.\n\nHikes in Yosemite valley can be difficult, due to the steep canyon walls. Yosemite falls is quite strenuous, and the half dome hike is over 4000ft of vertical climb. The final cables to the dome itself require a permit. The valley floor offers a nice flat loop and a very pleasant bike trail.\n\nFor the more adventurous, the high sierra wilderness offers an escape from civilization. Backcountry permits are required and there are huts that can be reserved in advance. Park access in February is limited due to the demand to see the FireFall phenomenon.\n\nYosemite offers an incredible wealth of experience  and should not be missed by anyone remotely interested in learning about natural history or simply standing in awe of 4000ft granite cliffs.",

This is considered moderate on AllTrails and boy was it. 3000 gain of elevation and then 600 steps to get to the top of the waterfall. To be honest, I prefer the views of the waterfall versus being at the top. I was sore for four days and it took me a while to get up there.\nWe also went to the lower Yosemite falls, and we went to bridal veil Falls .\nIt was a beautiful experience because we actually got to see El Capitan, the enormous rock that Alex Honnold climbed without rope.\nViews from glacier point are very pretty however, we loved the views from the sentinel dome .\n\nWe want to go back in the spring so that we can see those waterfalls in full bloom.\n\nIf I could give some advice to anyone is, if you go there with the group, do not hog up areas so that other people cannot take pictures. We ran into quite a few groups and they stood in the same area taking picture after picture after picture be respectful of other people wanting to be in that spot as well.",

I\u2019d choose that park over Yellowstone all day long. I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t a great park, but I would choose many others before this one.\n\nWe stayed at the Canyon camp ground which I did really enjoy.

Every season is beautiful in this national park.\nHighlights: Tunnel view, El capitan, Yosemite fall, Vernal fall, Nevada fall, Sentinel dome, Glacier point, Half dome.\nGood pizzas and breakfast in the curry village.\nIt shows beautiful colors in fall and spring. Best place when it snows. Amazing hikes in the summer.",

We saw (from a safe distance) 3 bears... make sure you check with the rangers about how to respond during bear sightings... And many other animals.\n\nAdditionally, the waterfalls were the strongest I've seen for this time of year due to record rain and snowfall last winter. This also contributed to a lush green valley floor with plants and flowers I hadn't seen in prior years.\n\nCurry Village is a great way to stay in the valley with kids...parking, tents with beds, close to bathrooms/showers, food and grocery, bike and raft rentals, and trailheads.\n\nWhether relaxing on the shores of the Merced River, biking around the Valley floor, or hiking to a waterfall, the views in all directions are awe inspiring.\n\nBe advised that as of writing this, the Mist Trail is closed Monday - Thursday, 7am-3:30 for maintenance and repairs. This led us to hike to Nevada Falls instead of Vernal Falls, but was totally worth it!!",

The waterfalls were overflowing and water was trickling down the granite from several areas all around the main falls. The rivers were really rolling and raging in many parts. It was such a tremendous display of the power to see the historic levels of snow from the past winter, melting into collective forces to create such beautiful waterfalls. There was light to moderate rain each day it seemed around 5 - 6 pm. This made the greenery all around lush and bountiful. The air was saturated with scents of pine/ fresh forest/ meadow. I could not breathe in all in enough. Absolutely majestic.\n\nTips: get to the park early, by 8 or earlier to find parking. Even during the week.\n\n- Don't depend on the shuttles. They only loop in one direction. If you want to get to a previous stop you will need to loop on the shuttle around for an hour and a half to get to it. It's faster just to walk.\n\n- In the afternoon most shuttle buses are full to capacity  anyway much of the time so there would be no way to even get on if you wanted. This means you'll probably do just one or two trails and leave the rest for another day/ visit. They may be more empty early morning/ later evening.\n\nPictures taken Monday, June 12, 2023.",

I had to throw away about 2 hours because there were so many restrictions on each section, but it was a really beautiful place. Unfortunately, I couldn't try Mirror Ray because the weather was too hot.\nIf I get a chance next time, I plan to try camping.",

Didn\u2019t need to make reservation for park entrance, but check the NPS website for updates. Glacier Road was closed. Shuttles were running slow & full like packed sardines.  East village (purple) shuttles were not in service. Visitor center was closed, but had services outside. Bridal Falls parking area was closed, but nearby parking area was open.

Mist Trail is so spectacular especially with the water rushing and all the mist to add to the experience. The trails are well maintained and the rest stops are well placed and greatly appreciated along the way.\n\nGot to speak with many nice people and make new friends on the journey.

Rocky wet steps, but there is about 100 feet of railing you can hold onto for balance. It\u2019s really not too bad. Next was Nevada Falls. Easy enough walk on over, but the best was yet to come. Took the Muir trail down. Get ready to be soaked. We had waterproof boots, but did not help. You will be walking through a fall. Ankle deep water. It was like being a kid playing in the water. Embrace it and push on through. Now, we are exhausted. Yes, mud and water is involved, but stay focused on your footing and have fun.",

This facility is really helpful with bus stopping in every 20 available view points.\nEvery stop has lot of restrooms available as well.\nThey even have rental bikes available for kids and adults to go around the valley that costs around 40$ per day. Even this is one of the easy ways to view all the places. They have bike paths around the valley and also enough bike parking area.\nGet early find a parking and go with shuttle or bikes.

Public restrooms and water fountains also clean and tidy for climbers use.  Trails command magnificent views of Half Dome and other peaks, and Yosemite Falls and other falls and lakes.  The trails are really worth walking, so private cars should be stopped driving all together in the area and tours and guides to good view sights should be provided more.",

Moreover, rangers are restricting access to some areas and paths (I should've asked a permit years ago to climb Half Dome??) or will only let you pass against payment or previous booking. It's very bureaucratic (but this is a general reproof I personally wanna make about U.S. National Parks. Of course, it's only my personal opinion) When I came back down from the summit of Half Dome, the path I had taken in the early morning was now closed, without explanation, forcing me to take a huge detour, climbing up again on the crests, at the hottest hours of the day, when I was already exhausted by the climb of the summit.\n\nNevertheless, Yosemite is definitely worth it. The view from Glacier Point was stunning and summitting Half Dome was one of the most fantastic experiences in my life. I wish I had time to do more trails in this amazing landscape.\n\nI recommend to choose a period when the park is less crowded. To avoid the crowd, I recommend to wake up early and to take some hight; The lower in the valley and the closer to Yosemite Village, the more people you'll meet.",

There is no cell service, so no rangers and no good maps make for alot of wanted time. Signage is bad, trails are not well blazed. The bus service is abysmal.... they pack the buses way beyond capacity. It is hard to believe that the government that manages yellowstone so well leaves this park to crumble. Road closures with poor notice are a major inconvenience.\n\nIf it was not for the natural beauty,  this place would not be worth it. If planning travel, pick yellowstone or denali.  It's a shame to see how mismanaged it is here. Bathrooms do not get cleaned, we came across two with feces on the wall and floor.\n\nShameful",

That drop had us on edge, elevation hit 8,000 ft so you can only imagine the horrifying ramifications from accidentally driving off it.\n\nFYI; If you miss the entrance to the waterfall viewing location you won't be able to loop back due to the raised cement median at the turnabout.\n\nWe only viewed a couple of hours, so when even a weeklong tour wouldn't give you the majority of what Yosemite holds we'll need to return and stay longer.\n\nFor the Fall changing of the colors of leaves you really need to visit mid-late November.  On 10.16.23 we only witnessed a very few trees just starting to turn yellow.\n\nPics of HUGE waterfall, maybe 1,500+ ft(?) & Merced River (very cold).  For full blast raging waterfalls come in April or May when waterflow is at its peak.\n\n*During the drive to the Park we almost hit a huge young male deer who sprinted in front of us running across the road, just jumped out from the foliage.  If I hadn't checked the brake we would've collided w.it, we missed him by only inches.  This was so scary being so sudden, a fright and then relief for both us and that deer.  There are bear & deer crossing signs along both lanes. Please keep that in mind, it can happen to you.",

During the busy middle of the day plan on staying off of the roads and enjoy picnics, hikes and watching nature, because those are the busiest times. Some roads close in the summer once the area gets filled up, such as Marriposa Grove, so if you don't come early you won't be able to see that area at all. If you can stay overnight and watch the stars in the summer it is amazing! Housekeeping camp has showers and coin operated laundry which are very nice. To see animals, stick to the least populated areas of the park.",

It was very hot out but if you have school age kids and want a 2 hour quick tour you can take the open air bus ride from the Yosemite Lodge! It was well worth it! You don't have to be a guest at the hotel to enjoy the bus ride or the cafe at the Lodge. The parknwas clean and there were visitors from all over the world. I wish reservations weren't needed but I can see how they are necessary.",

Stayed at a hotel close to the park the night before and when we arrived at the entrance via El Portal slightly past 7am , there were only a few cars in front of us.\nDrove  another hour to reach glacial point, no issue to find parking ( the toilets there really sucked). When we got to our second destination down at the Yosemite Village area close to 10am  it was more crowded, however, no car queue and we are able to get a lot.  Overall, the permit and reservation system to manage peak period traffic helped to ensure a more pleasant visit for all.  Keep it up!",

I would charge at Oakhurst to between 80-90 percent and going in and out it would use around 15-20 percent. The first day and found a trickle charger in the valley at the lodge and charged while we hiked, but that day we actually ended up with more than 85 percent charge left by the time we got to Oakhurst due to regeneration on the way down. The last day we went all the way into the valley, and then up to glacier point and used ~35 percent. Doing Yosemite on an EV was great. This time of year the park was beautiful, nice temperature, it did rain the last day pretty hard but it was still a great trip.",

From the moment I entered the park, I was greeted by stunning natural beauty that seemed almost otherworldly.\n\nThe iconic granite cliffs, majestic waterfalls, and lush greenery created a picturesque landscape that felt like stepping into a postcard. The sheer magnitude of El Capitan and Half Dome left me speechless, and I couldn\u2019t help but admire the wonders of nature.\n\nThe park\u2019s management deserves praise for their dedication to preserving the natural habitat. The facilities were well-maintained, and the informative signage and ranger-led programs enhanced my understanding of Yosemite\u2019s ecological significance.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a nature enthusiast, an avid hiker, or simply seeking a tranquil escape, Yosemite National Park offers something for everyone. The sheer grandeur of the landscape, coupled with its diverse flora and fauna, make it a destination that should be on every traveler\u2019s bucket list.\n\nI cannot recommend Yosemite enough. It is a place where nature\u2019s beauty unfolds before your eyes, leaving you with memories that will last a lifetime. Prepare to be captivated by the park\u2019s majesty, and don\u2019t forget your camera \u2013 you\u2019ll want to capture every moment of this awe-inspiring journey!",

Start as early as possible of you want to go to the top of the falls.  Also a rain jacket is recommended for the hike to the top as the falls will rain on you.  Hiking poles are helpful.\n\nFor any hikes, bring plenty of water and listen to your body.\n\nWe came through the Tunnel View from Wawonna Road.

If I had researched better I would have come earlier in the Summer or late Spring even if it meant more crowds. Also, the trail to the mist waterfalls was very strenuous.",

I would highly recommend  wearing long pants and getting the all trails map. Not going to lie though we were amateurs and it showed. I would not go on this trail with kids.

I definitely do recommend driving in through the tunnel. It's not just the valley that is amazing though, all of it is. Outside of the valley in the mountains there are Giant Sequoias. (Huge trees, over a hundred feet tall) I do definitely recommend going to Yosemite in the springtime, it is very alive and lots water. I just absolutely LOVE Yosemite!\ud83d\ude0d The squirrels there are very cute but just make sure to not feed them. Sometimes you will get to see a bear and that is very cool. as long as there are a good distance away from you it's ok. There is also a lot of deer you can always find. The deer also aren't scared of humans so you just have to make sure that you keep you distance. There is also bobcats you can sometimes see, they are more rare though. At night the stars are very bright and pretty, so definitely to recommend that. From up high the view is also really good, doing at least one high up hike is always good to do so you can see the beauty from up there. If you want to go to one of the Giant Sequoia groves DEFINITELY go to Mariposa Grove. Tuolumne Grove is disappointing. I think that's all I have to say but overall AMAZING.\ud83d\ude0d",

I've been coming here since I was a kid, almost 50 years now, and I've never seen the park so spectacular. I saw fast flowing falls in places that are almost always dry. Incredible.\n\nThat being said, we visited a week before memorial day, which I suppose is technically the \"off\" season. Despite a good crowd, park services were limited at best. Most of the eateries were closed, and those that we found open were busy, tended by obviously stressed out and tired workers.\n\nShuttle buses were running at 30 minute intervals--with most of them packed to capacity. On a number of occasions, drivers were forced to leave a dozen or so people behind; the bus was just too full. Parking was relatively easy by comparison, and we found ourselves wishing we had ignored guidelines & driven from place to place.\n\nThe final blow was an empty ice cream freezer in the village store.\n\nWe tend to visit in the off season, so some limitations in service are not unexpected. I do wish, though, that park management could be more flexible. In a time of epic conditions and nice weather, they should be ready to scale up to meet the demand.",

So make time and do visit.\nMake at least 3 day trip, try to stay in Yosemite valley itself if the lodges are open, they get booked in lightening speed or stay in nearby city.\n\nWe were lucky to get one day accommodation in curry village, other nights we stayed in Mariposa. we took the advantage of the day we stayed in curry village and did mist trail hike to Nevada fall.\n\nAlways start your day as soon as possible and reach valley before 7:30am to enjoy crowd free views and hikes.",

To complete the half dome hike you require a booking and then you can do that. There are many small hikes. You have to visit glacier point to see a magnificent view. You can camp in the park but for that you need to book a spot for your RV or tent area. You'll find a bear, a deer. If you're a bird enthusiast then you'll love this place. There are many trails for hiking as well like lower Yosemite fall, upper Yosemite fall, and half dome trail. The best time to visit is in spring if you like snow then winter but in winter some of the parts are closed for visitors. You'll find many types of wild animals, if you're lucky you'll encounter a fox which is a rare sight. You'll require at least 4 days to explore the whole Yosemite park without travel time. Some of the places from where you will find beautiful views, a tunnel view and a glacier point view. Sunset from the tunnel view is a must to experience.",

We hiked past the Grizzly Giant and got away from the crowds.   Going on some of the lesser known trails, we were able to see more trees.  It's hard to imagine those trees have been around for thousands of years.  Our second day was spent in Yosemite Valley.  We hiked to Vernal Falls, which was a challenging hike.  We spent the afternoon exploring the Valley, going to the visitor's center, theater, and museum.  We finished by walking at the base of El Capitan, watching rock climbers.   Our final day was spent in Toulumme Meadows.   We hiked to Dog Lake and Lambert Dome.   We also stopped, and marvelled  the Meadows.   We stopped at Tenya Lake and had lunch on the beach.   Our last stop was Olmsted Point.  Here you can see how the glaciers carved the granite millions of years ago.   When visiting YNP, be prepared to drive.   We stayed in Groveland, CA and had to drive 40 mins to get to the park.  The shuttles in the valley are convenient, and easy to use.   Yosemite is a beautiful place, and I'm thankful I got to visit.",

Giant trees, silent witnesses to centuries of human existence, stand tall with their roots relentlessly penetrating the hard rock, a constant reminder of persistence.\n\nLook up at the mountains, their white peaks a majestic sight. If you're lucky, you might even witness cascading glaciers as they melt, a display of nature's raw power that will command both admiration and respect.\n\nThe journey doesn't end there. The vibrant shrubs thriving near the riverbanks and at the foot of the mountains, bursting with color and variety, offer a beautiful lesson in diversity and its importance to humanity.\n\nYosemite is a classroom with endless lessons. The drive itself is an adventure, with the road meandering up and down, crisscrossing rivers, a testament to the ingenuity of those who carved a path where none existed before.\n\nCome explore Yosemite National Park and experience its magic for yourself!",

The veiws are amazing.\n**My favorite was definitely the Glacier Point look out. It gives you a bird's eye view of the park essentially. This road is open at select times so check on that a head of time.\nAlso... Be prepared to be patient, there are lots of people.\nAlso- don't leave your trash, the amount of purposefully place trashed I found left behind was incredibly sad\ud83d\ude22",

When we visited in late summer, Yosemite Falls was considerably less spectacular but magnificent nonetheless!\n\nLife and Mother Nature are absolutely amazing and this special place just reminds us of this fact!\n\nLast year, we hiked the Mirror Lake Trail. This year, we hiked the Nevada Falls Mist Trail.\n\nOur Portuguese Water Dog service animal Mack made our visit so much more special!\n\nThe views are absolutely spectacular. It\u2019s nice to drive through the park, but even more fun and special when fully experiencing by hiking it! There were many campsites as well. I\u2019ll have to do that next time!\n\nEvery encounter we had was incredibly positive! It was really nice exchanging stories with travelers, couples and families from all over the country and world!\n\nPlease see separate entries for the individual hikes at Yosemite National Park.\n\nWe will be returning very soon!",

            "review": "Yosemite National Park is an awe-inspiring and breathtaking destination. The snow melts generously, filling the waterfalls to their brim, creating a majestic spectacle. The valleys are adorned with beautiful purple and white flowers, while lush green meadows attract graceful butterflies.\n\nOur recent one-day trip to Yosemite left an indelible mark on our memories. The water flow this year was truly remarkable, and we had the privilege of hiking the mist trail. As we walked along the trail, it felt as though we were enveloped in a torrential downpour, refreshed by the mist's embrace. The view from the waterfall's pinnacle was simply breathtaking. With an array of activities spanning over 14 miles and a journey of more than 350 miles, our Father's Day weekend was a fulfilling adventure.\n\nHowever, it is essential for the National Park Service (NPS) to reevaluate their parking arrangements. The influx of cars allowed into the park often leads to congestion at the valley entrance, compelling visitors to park farther away and rely on shuttle buses. Unfortunately, the frequency and capacity of these shuttles do not align with the number of park visitors.\n\nTo address this concern, I propose the following measures to the NPS:\n\n1) Increase the parking capacity within the park to accommodate a greater number of vehicles, alleviating parking-related issues.\n2) Consider implementing a system to regulate the park's visitor count, such as reintroducing a reservation system. This will help manage the flow of visitors and prevent overcrowding.\n3) Ensure that the frequency and capacity of the shuttle buses are adjusted to cater to the number of visitors, enabling efficient transportation throughout the park.\n\nGiven the significance of these issues, it would be beneficial to bring them to the attention of the park superintendent. By proactively addressing these concerns, we can enhance the overall visitor experience and ensure the long-term sustainability of Yosemite National Park.",

Highly recommend staying at the nicer hotel so you can enjoy their breakfast and dinners as the other options are very weak, especially for breakfast.",

The park's towering granite cliffs, cascading waterfalls, and ancient sequoia trees create a landscape that feels like it's straight out of a dream.\n\nAs an avid hiker, I was thrilled to explore the countless trails that wind through Yosemite. Each path offered a unique adventure, leading me to hidden gems and breathtaking viewpoints. The hike to Half Dome was a personal highlight, rewarding me with panoramic vistas that left me speechless.\n\nBut Yosemite is not just for the adventurous souls. It's a place where one can find solace and tranquility amidst nature's embrace. I spent hours simply sitting by the Merced River, listening to the soothing sounds of water and feeling a sense of peace wash over me. It was a reminder of the power and serenity that nature can provide.\n\nThe wildlife in Yosemite is abundant and diverse. From deer gracefully grazing in meadows to elusive bears roaming the forests, every encounter felt like a privilege. I was reminded of the importance of preserving these habitats and ensuring the continued existence of these magnificent creatures.\n\nAnd let's not forget the night sky in Yosemite. Away from the city lights, the stars shone brilliantly, painting the sky with their celestial glow. I found myself mesmerized by the vastness of the universe, feeling humbled and connected to something greater than myself.\n\nYosemite National Park is a place that leaves an indelible mark on your soul. It's a sanctuary where nature's beauty knows no bounds. Whether you're an outdoor enthusiast, a nature lover, or simply seeking a peaceful escape, Yosemite will exceed your expectations. It's a place that reminds us of the wonders that exist in our world and the importance of preserving them for future generations.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Yosemite National Park to anyone seeking an unforgettable experience. Prepare to be amazed, inspired, and forever changed by the sheer magnificence of this natural wonder.",

If you do visit and happen to get lucky enough to see a bear, please do not feed them... if they come back at a later time looking for food and hurt someone, they could be put down. :-(  We are spoiled with living so close and getting to visit often, and I can honestly say that this was easily one of our most memorable visits ever! Can't wait to come back in a month or so! Yes, it's summer now, so there are a TON of people and crowds and lines...if you do not like crowds, you may be better off visiting in the fall or winter months (still just as beautiful and breathtaking). It is also pet friendly,  but for the love of all things good... Please pick up after your animals and DO NOT LEAVE TRASH EVERYWHERE (no trash can nearby? Bring an extra trash bag and pack it out with you)! Let's all try to do our part and keep this majestic place beautiful for others to enjoy as well!",

We arrived 7:45AM and buying America the Beautiful annual pass was really easy at the entrance with credit card only. Yosemite Falls parking lot has enough space and hiking took 3.5hrs to go up. Walking down is bit harder because of heat from sun up the sky. But it all worths trying and I saw a baby BEAR at the returning way!!",

There is just one thing that led to one less star for me. I went with my sister and she almost died at the Roosevelt trail. While walking on the trail, her leg got pierced by something. This caused her to faint and almost die. So if you are deciding to go here, make sure to be wary around your surroundings and be careful not to be pierced with anything... Even if it looks harmless or is on trails. But overall, as I said, amazing scenery! You will enjoy the park with all of its beauty.",

The lower Yosemite falls, curry village, awahene lodge etc. are must visits. If you come with family or friends, have lots of activities to do here. Can get into water in the river in the middle of the village.",

Reservations required except for locals 'passing through.'  We left this time after lunch and they line was 2 + miles long.  What took less than 3 minutes at 6 took over any hour at noon.\nThe park is, of course, magnificent even partially shut down.  The tunnel view at dawn is wonderful.  People friendly.  Vendors a bit worn out and lunch at then lodge seemed overpriced.  The lodge is a must see.  Otherwise, the views, meadows and streams, half done and El capitan were incredible.  Many foreign tourists were fun to observe.  In all, go early.",

No lines, plenty of areas to pull over and take spectacular photos. The falls were gorgeous. The roads well cared for and plenty of park rangers around helping cars that needed assistance. The Big Oak Flat gas station was closed but we found another near by in El Portal.  There are no gas station in the park.",

The options on how you interact with those features are endless. There are many campgrounds in the park but most will sell out months in advance. Same thing with the cabins, you must reserve sites early! There are two free shuttles in the park - green which runs valley wide, and purple which serves only the most popular eastern end. Aim to at least visit Lower Yosemite Falls, Vernal Falls, Happy Isles, and Glacier Point in a day or two to hit many major highlights. If you really want a proper test, attempt Half Dome but only if you can get a permit! Arrive at the park very early to be guaranteed a parking spot, otherwise you'll be walking a long ways or be overly dependent on the shuttle.",

Even the speed limit is too fast at times to take in the sights.\nAs you can see from my photos... forest fires in the region have created a lack of clarity.",

There are very strenuous hikes for those who seek them (like Half Dome which I completed!), more moderate ones with fantastic views with easy and accesible paths for all and so much to do for those with young children too, like the Valley Floor. The backcountry here is gorgeous! This National Park has it all and checks off anything you are looking for from an outdoor trip! This place is heaven on Earth and is definitely a trip I will be repeating. I think I have found my favorite place on Earth! Anyone who can, should experience this part of our beautiful country and what I think is one of the best National Parks out there!!!",

The landscapes in this park are vast\u2014perfect for all kinds of adventures.\nNot just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.\n\nFirst protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.\n\nLike for more..",

I was fortunate that I visited in the wintertime as I was told by our guide that the crowds and the traffic is light.\n\nIt was really amazing! Words fail to describe the majesty. And fortunately, a week prior to my visit, it snowed - and as it warmed up, snow was melting, so the falls were really beautiful.\n\nI visited the park by using a tour service which due to the drive along the winding roads through the Sierra Nevada mountains I highly recommend it. There were a lot of seemingly dangerous curves and the drive seemed somewhat harrowing. I'm glad that I didn't drive myself.\n\nThere is a food court in the middle of the park with pizza, burgers, and a few other select food items, in a cafeteria type setting. The food was OK, nothing to write about or to review, and also a bit pricey.\n\nThere is also a shuttle that routinely drives back and forth throughout one side of the park roughly every 15 to 30 minutes (check the schedule). so it's easier to see a little bit more and then shuttle back to the lodge area or parking area.",

We enjoyed the pizza place at Camp Curry. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was that the shuttles are not running as regularly as usual. We often waited 45-60 minutes to be picked up and they were packed full. We stayed in the whited canvas tent cabins in Curry, but there are also more rustic options in the camp grounds or a little more comforts in the cabins in Curry or the Awahnee hotel. This is a great place for a day trip of spend a week with the family. It's cool in the evening and morning but warms up through the day. Bring mosquito spray!",

This is a moderate to strenuous hike and requires a high level of physical fitness. But the view and the experience is worth every step you take to get there. The trail consists of places to take water and go to the bathroom in between. It is important to wear waterproof clothes because when you get to the waterfall, it expels a lot of rain and you can get soaked.",

Reservations is required to enter and should be made one week ahead for the day of. $35 for day use for 3 days is a good deal. We left our home at 7am and arrived at the entrance by 930am. Arriving early is a must so you don't go through the long line and can find parking. The first waterfall we saw entering the park was the Bridalveil Falls. It was beautiful and parking was available along the road to park and take photos. We took the Valley Loop trail. From Yosemite Lodge to the Lower Falls was about 15 minutes. We then took the trail that lead to Mirror Lake. The walk was 2.5 hours. The end point was \ud83d\ude31. You can see Mt. Watkins, Ahwiyah Point and Half Dome. There are mosquitoes, so bug repellent is a must. Will definitely come back and take more trails",

Clean, well maintained trails and you could just feel nature walking with you the whole way. Lots of squirrels saying hi along the way. The hike to Half Dome was eight hours to and back. Along the way you can see three waterfalls, which are breathtaking and beautiful. The trails gradually increase in elevation. Challenging hike for those who aren't physically fit. The waterfalls you are able to just go in, but sometimes can be slippery on the rocks so do be careful. Dogs are allowed here so don't be afraid to bring your pup! Camping is a recommendation, since it's a good price but you need a reservation because of how packed it could get. Very popular place to go.",

No matter how much time you spend at the park it will not be enough to explore it.  Wild life was rare due to time of the year but we managed to see some deer, a coyote, and a bear.  We traveled in an RV and found an immediate spot just outside the park.  There are plenty of spaces for class A RVs but I encourage you to try not to bring one to the park.  I had a class A and going down the mountains was as hard as going up.  The roads are very narrow and many times the white line on the edge of the road is also the edge of the cliff.  Diesel and gas aren\u2019t cheap for a class A guzzler.  Expect to pay around $5 per gallon.\nFires destroy everything, be super careful.",

Road signage\u2019s are not appropriate specially when Internet connectivity is not there and google maps are not working. The maps that we received at the entry point, were of great help. On the weekends finding parking slots is also an issue. You have to roam around searching for parking slots and polluting the area by vehicular emissions. There are abundant public rest rooms for public convenience. Overall not a great experience.",

We did three strenuous hikes (mist trail to Nevada falls, four mile trail and upper Yosemite falls) and while they were hellish going up, the views were heavenly. There\u2019s a lot of less strenuous hikes as well, and the rangers are super helpful in recommending stuff to do. There\u2019s plenty of things to do with kids. There are a lot of restrooms, but many of them are porta potties. A lot of roads are still closed, so do your research so you know where to go. As for parking: COME EARLY! The big parking lots fill up slower and there\u2019s still parking before 9AM, but some of the smaller ones, like the one for the four mile trail, fills up before 7AM. Once you find a spot, leave your car there and walk/take the shuttle, even though the shuttles are crowded.",

We take Rocky Mountain National Park for granted since we live somewhat close. The vista at tunnel view is unbelievable. We struggled to find the visitor center with all the construction going on but when we did find it, the family had a great time doing the Junior Ranger badge and watching the Yosemite movie in the theater. My only complaint is that we only had one day and a long drive to our next destination, so we felt rushed. We stopped at Mariposa Grove and it was incredible as well. I hope to make it back when there is less construction and the falls are running. Bridal Veil was just a trickle and Upper Yosemite Falls was barely anything, but it's October and a dry year. What an incredible experience!",

It is located in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California, USA and attracts millions of visitors every year. The park is known for its stunning granite cliffs, waterfalls, and diverse wildlife.\n\nOne of the main attractions in Yosemite is the Yosemite Valley, which is surrounded by towering granite cliffs like El Capitan and Half Dome. The valley is also home to the famous Yosemite Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in North America. Visitors can take hiking trails to get up close to the falls, or simply admire them from afar.\n\nThe park is also a paradise for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts, with over 800 miles of trails that wind through forests, meadows, and up to stunning viewpoints. Hikes range from easy walks to strenuous multi-day treks, and there are options for all skill levels.\n\nIn addition to hiking, visitors can also go rock climbing, fishing, camping, and horseback riding. In the winter, the park offers cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.\n\nYosemite is also home to a diverse range of wildlife, including black bears, mountain lions, coyotes, and deer. Birdwatchers can spot over 250 species of birds, including the endangered California Condor.\n\nThe park is also known for its rich history and cultural significance, with numerous historic buildings and sites that tell the story of the people who have called the area home for thousands of years.\n\nOverall, Yosemite National Park is a must-visit destination for anyone who loves nature, adventure, and outdoor exploration. The park's stunning natural beauty, rich history, and endless opportunities for adventure make it a truly unforgettable experience.",

As to the latter, it should be a simple fix - trail signage is lacking, so the simple act of walking a loop around the Valley is more challenging than it should be, and the NPS never even bothered to cite walking distances on the map. Fixing the former represents a bigger challenge, but is a necessity - the experience of the Valley, the most iconic portion of one of America's greatest parks, is spoiled by the inundation of automobiles. Yosemite deserves better - the park should be closed to private vehicles and served instead by shuttles. One of this country's premier natural areas should not be marred by what amounts to a highway running through its entire length.",

Everyone has their phones out and ear buds in.\n\nSave your money.",

The worst part for me was the park Rangers. Seemed like the only reason they were there was to harass everyone and did not care to help when we asked.\n\nWe made a mistake and setup camp on a side of the campground that was closed off, however there were no visible signs from where we entered. We were woken up from our sleep by a ranger (which of course is understandable if the campground was closed) but he harassed us and asked about 6 times if we had firearms with us, we told him no the first time but he continued to ask repeatedly as if we were going to magically say yes, and to make it worse, when we asked him for help on how to fill out the reservation card his response was (you guys are adults you can figure it out on your own) let me add that was there was absolutely no instructions on what to do. So, my buddy and I filled out the card and campground that we found, put the money with it and dropped it in the box because that was the only thing that made any sense. The next day when we returned from our hike we found park rangers confiscated all our belongings from our locker (even though we filled out the card and paid for it.) perhaps we made a mistake but had the ranger decided to help us out instead of harassing us looking for reasons to arrest us, this could have been avoided. After he was done harassing he went around the campground looking inside every single vehicle for other other people to harass which he did to a few others. I used to like this place but I will NEVER go back after this last experience",

At least that! Still sad we missed out.\n\nWe were really looking forward to a Valley Floor Tour. We followed several people's recommendations and took the YARTS bus into the valley from our lodging and booked the Valley Floor Tour to get our bearings and insights about Yosemite Valley. The bus was a little delayed due to traffic and flagging for road work, but we arrived at the Yosemite Valley Lodge location and the tram with time to spare. Staff were outside instead of at the ticket counter, but had our tickets.\n\nAs people started loading onto the tram, they were \"saving spaces\" and refusing to move over to allow all ticketed passengers on the tram. It was already rather crowded with 4 to 6 people in each row. (People are bigger these days and there were multiple small children (less than ticketed age) taking up seats!) Staff were unwilling to make an issue of getting people to move over to allow all remaining ticketed passengers to board the tram. Rather than turning \"ugly\" and \"making a scene\" we just gave up and offered to get refunded for our tickets. The staff member said \"ok\".\n\nWe went inside to get refunded and were told \"NO - we don't do refunds\".  At this point, the tram was pulling out.  When the outside staff member came back in, we asked him to intercede on our behalf since he had seen the issue. He said he would ask the manager about a refund and when he came back, said \"no - we can only move you to a later tour\".  Well we already had later tickets booked on the YARTS bus and plans for the remainder of the day.  We were only in the valley the one day.\n\nSo - now we were out $80 and also had the experience of dealing with RUDE people unwilling to make space and several staff members who were unwilling to provide customer service and either ensure we were able to board the tram or refund our tickets. All 3 staff members we talked to had an \"I don't care\" or \"too bad\" attitude.\n\nThe experience ruined my day. Several days later, I am still broken hearted at having our plans and visit ruined after trying to follow recommendations to use the YARTS bus, the valley shuttles, and to take the valley tour given our limited time. I will continue to provide bad online reviews and tell everyone who will listen to avoid the Valley Floor Tour.\n\nFurther, the shuttle buses in the valley were arriving back to back and multiple locations around the valley.  As seniors, we also had to stand on most of the buses until we passed up on the first two busses and got on the third in a row.  Many of the driver microphones were not working so that people could hear to move back in the bus and/or get on in the front and off in the back. Buses were super crowded with seniors and handicapped people left standing in the aisles with challenges to hang on.\n\nWorst Experience Ever! NPS needs to review the ARAMARK contract and ensure corrective action is taken to make sure shuttles are safely operated and the concessionaires provide good customer service and not oversell and crowd tours. This was a completely unacceptable experience and given that it's early in the season, it's only likely to get worse.",

Go to the government site to double check closures as they are maintaining several areas of the park and Tioga road closes in the winter.",

The forest, endless waterfalls and lakes, amazing hikes, and village were all great to experience.  We climbed Half Dome thanks to our permit and it\u2019s one of my favorite hikes I have done anywhere on this planet (I even put it over Angels Landing in Zion).  It is a very strenuous hike and you should be in good shape physically and have the mental fortitude to make it through the day.  It gets hot quick so tons of water and food are highly recommended.  There are also lakes and streams along the way to refill so bring a filter- we went through 200 ounces of water each to get up and back!  The cables are a tremendous forearm, cardio, and leg workout so be prepared for that!  People are respectful for the most part on the cables so over communicate to the people in front of and behind you so you are as safe as can be up there.  The view from the top is absolutely amazing and well worth the adventure to get there!  I cannot recommend Yosemite enough and even if you don\u2019t have the permit to do Half Dome it is totally worth the visit!!",

The reason that it's a not perfect score from my experience was more of the timing of going which was end of November, which meant no snow and no active waterfalls and it wasn't spring where the flowers were blooming and the waterfalls were flowing. However the fall made the trees look very nice from the color changing leaves everywhere. If you do go on the hikes the intermediate ones are definitely for the people who are somewhat athletic and the advanced shouldn't be attempted without some walking sticks. Also I'd recommend layering to help prevent you from sweating through your layers from all the walking.",

Later in the year its not so busy and the water flows are much lower but in spring/ early summer it's a constant and pleasant assault on the senses. The Park is old and crowded,  the RV spaces are small, your neighbors are camping in your back pocket and everyone walks through your campsite at will but the vistas are not available anywhere else on the west coast if not the contential US. and that's from someone who pulled a trailer 15k miles around the lower 49 in 2020.   Yes, get out and go see this country but don't miss Yosemite even if you only have an afternoon to drive through or take a bus tour, even if you only get to stand in the meadow and soak it all in, it's not to be missed. The Park is so much more then just then Yosemite Valley it's self but IMO it all starts there. My greatest memories are  Half Dome with my daughters and the bridge/ Mist trail with my grandkids.\n\nEdit.. A quick visit mid-june 2023 with historic winter snowpak and high river  flows. we must have seen 2 dozen small waterfalls that may not even be named (it rained every afternoon) surprizingly Yosemite falls it'self wasn't much more impressive (the weather was cool) but Bridal Veil was just awesome, much bigger and grander then I've ever seen it. The trail is closed at this time but at Tunnel View you can get the bigger picture.",

The wildlife and scenery is breathtaking. The trails are fun and provide different levels of challenging terrain. Its peaceful and calming rivers promote an infinite amount of space and opportunity for mediation. When visiting this region, travel with an open mind and plenty of time. Do not rush as the roads are extremely curvy. But don\u2019t let that deter you as this place is absolute work, the travel, displaying indescribable beauty. The facilities within the national park are overall pretty clean and well stocked. There\u2019s places where water bottles can be refilled with clean cold filtered water.

I lived in a little town called Coursegold(1 of the best Antique places)before you start passing into Oakhurst(1 of the best Antique places) & Fish Camp(name states all)  last tourist signs, stores, etc then before you realize BOOM! Yosemite. Shootz, I used to drive that road 80mph easy anyway of the week; loved it... then they opened another tribal casino(Chukchansi Gold Resort & Casino=AMAZING BUFFET!All separatedby type of food- american, asian,mexican,soul, etc. ) in the area; ruining a good 2 lane drive. I know CHPs reports in 2003-2005 had to be off the charts just from just in let's say a 10mile stretch of Highway 41 with the casino in the middle so either direction the driver is heading. None of us that drove the road as the back of my hand even racing around on it since it's only a 2 lane highway. Also ck out Highway 41 (if the southern gate you headed) for any road construction, road/driving conditions, & do you need new brakes or tires(replace them before the summer road trip). FOR REAL! #ifykyk 41NB in the mountains don't have much of any type of even \"bike lane\" its to close to mountains so you don't wanna breakdown anywhere on 41NB because it'll cause the additional stress & anxiety of getting hit & blocking traffic- unless you work put crew & you'll have that tire change done lickidy split! It's probably one of the other non tourist in the area, take in the drive to Yosemite; it's beautiful \ud83d\ude0d.",

Don't leave any food or smelly items in your car, as these will attract them. Be sure to bring warm layers, it gets very cold at night! The best short hikes are to the falls and around half dome. Drive up the panoramic viewpoint too to get some great shots.",

We did trails every day, we saw children, couples with babies and older people doing too, we just didn't do the hardest ones.

We chose to leave the hotel at 6:30 which us to the main part of Yosemite before 8 am -- already a bit busy on a weekend, but still much easier to find parking than even an hour later.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.",

But you must book ahead during holiday weekends. There are restaurants and kiosks at both lodges where you can purchase/eat foods (quite delicious). Ahwhanee hotel also provides food for the general public.\n\nFor tent campers, Camp 4 is well situated and first come first serve.\n\nFor hiking, the Mist trail or the John Muir trail are good for the experienced hikers. Mirror lake trail and Lower Yosemite fall trail are easier for beginners or families with kids.\n\nIf you want to ski/snowboard, Badger ski resort is nearby.\n\nThere\u2019s no WIFI in the park except for the lodging areas.

This journey, fraught with trials and tribulations, is a testament to adventure's unpredictable nature. Firstly, the sustenance provided was of such a dreadful quality that it induced the most distressing malady upon my person, causing a relentless bout of liquid diarrhea. This unfortunate affliction necessitated changing my pajama bottoms, a most undignified ordeal. My bunkmate was a constant source of misery. Despite the ample legroom provided by our bunks, he insisted on sleeping with his legs dangling off the bed. I can confirm the adequacy of the legroom, for we are of near identical stature, and I managed to keep both legs comfortably within the confines of my bed. Furthermore, they vehemently denied the habit and snored with such ferocity that it was impossible to attain a restful slumber. The accommodations were in a deplorable state, the rooms being both filthy and worn. Another compatriot consumed an excessive amount of caffeine and was a perpetual source of disturbance. The company was further marred by a barrage of inappropriate jests concerning the human anatomy and acts of a most indecent nature. To compound our woes, there was a complete absence of Wi-Fi, rendering it impossible to send or receive messages or partake in the simple pleasure of watching YouTube during our idle moments. Entertainment was sorely lacking, making our downtime excruciatingly dull. The bathing facilities offered scant privacy, the flimsy curtains affording one the dubious privilege of glimpsing one's comrades in their natural state. The cabins lacked heating, necessitating to kindle a fire within a diminutive furnace, its tiny chimney expelling smoke to the heavens. One of our compatriots, I must note, enjoyed the exclusive luxury of a private room, a manifestly unfair arrangement, especially given her solitary female presence on this excursion. Moreover, my bunkmate exhibited the most unbecoming cowardice at the sight of a bat native to the wilderness surrounding our cabin, letting slip an expletive of the most vulgar kind. Yet, amid this adversity, a beacon of joy emerged in the form of the middle schoolers from a neighbouring school. Their company was a delight, their presence a rare and cherished pleasure in an otherwise dismal adventure.",

If you\u2019re able to, visit the park and enjoy it\u2019s beauty.\nA few tips:\n1. If you\u2019re staying outside of the park, get to the park gate early. On a Saturday, we got to the gate by 8 a.m and had no issues finding parking\n2. If you easily get nauseous from windy drives, get mentally ready, once you pass the entrance gates, it\u2019s about 50 minutes till you get to the main parking area and it\u2019s mostly windy roads\n3. Right after the tunnel, there\u2019s parking to the right if you would like to take pictures of some amazing views\n4. Figuring out where to go and park is confusing, look for signs for Yosemite Village parking\n5. If you forget snacks or even a backpack, don\u2019t worry, they have lots of snacks and supplies at the village store; you can even get tums from a vending machine\n6. Figuring out hikes and where to go is difficult; there\u2019s a hiking map right next to the Yosemite village parking that tells you the difficulty levels\n7. Layer up, it\u2019s cold in the morning and gets hot quickly\n8. Have fun!",

Then started coming on my own once I could drive, and now I go as often as I can to spend time in the magic of the valley, the high country, and in the meadows above the valley. Yosemite is an amazingly beautiful park that we are so lucky we get to visit. The water falls are extra amazing in the spring, watching the leaves change in the fall is amazing, make the trip up to tuolumne once the valley gets too hot and try to come at least once in the winter to see the valley covered in snow. It's an amazing place. Please don't trash the park!",

Pack sandwiches, snacks, and water. Make sure to have a bakcpack and phone charger too.\n\nRecommend purchasing the $80 pass to visit all National Parks. Daily pass is $35. The $80 pays for itself in 2 days of visiting national parks.\n\nWe love staying just a few miles from park entrance at Tenaya Lodge.\n\nYosemite is perfect to visit all year long. However, the special treat to see the illusion of a  'lava' flow from the 'firefalls' or frozen water falls is a must do. January and Febraury perfect months to see the pseudo lava falls - 5:30pm during sunset, the sun reflects the rays at a perfect angle for a beautiful 13 minutes to enjoy the majestic lava flow. Park near the falls or near the Bridge. The walk is about 20 minutes time to find a spot to rest, chill, and wait. Wait time is most important since lot's of people walk and wait.\n\nTake a light chair, snacks, water, warm clothes, jacket, gloves, beanie, and have patience. Worth the wait.\n\nAlso, enjoy the drive on highway 41 through Yosemite. Make sure to return on HWY 41 because some people make mistake and end up on a different Highway like 120 going in opposite direction.\n\nHalf Dome photos a must.\nTwin Falls a must. Park and Hike around the area.\nPark near the Lava falls and walk and enjoy more waterfalls in area. So worth it.\nOn way out of park, during snow, stop at the fun snow area to enjoy time with kids. Make sure to buy several round plastic snow sliding thingies. Well worth the fun times!\n\nAlso, plan a day to go to Badger Pass for skiing or snowboarding. Arrive around 12pm for half price tickets; otherwise get there early. We enjoyed the slopes on skiis and snowboards for 5 hours.\n\nExcellent place to enjoy adult beverages, burgers, salads, and snack.\n\nLove Yosemite.",

You can easily miss landmarks you plan on seeing while looking for parking. So try to plan ahead. We had to take a shuttle from landmark 7, and it only goes 1 way so we have to do the full tour of stops of 19 landmarks. We were on the shuttle for 50 mins. Now if you don't have a baby and it's not hot you can easily walk from one landmark to the next.\n\n30 bucks to get it, bridalveil falls and glacier point are both closed for 2022 season.",

I hiked to the very top of the Nevada Fall and the view was amazing, but by the end of the hike(after I went up and came back down from Nevada Falls), my legs were extremely tired.\nBy the way, small tip:\nHike up the mountain with the long route, it has no steps, just a long concrete(or whatever material is used) route circling the mountain, then come back down with 6000+ extremely steep steps. If you go up by the steps, you\u2019re likely to give up not even halfway.",

My brother from another mother talked me into taking a one day road trip with him and I can\u2019t thank him enough! A beautiful sunny day with oh so blue skies highlighting the yellow leaves of fall. Blessed to see cool water running over the falls and down the Merced River! Stop by the Village Store if you get hungry, forgot to bring something or want souvenirs. If you are looking for the Visitors Center, park at the Village Store and follow the trail behind it as you take a short walk to the Visitors Center where there is no public parking. It was so nice to interact with people from all over the country and find that we truly have much more in common than we realize.",

As a first time visitor this past January, I cant tell anyone enough about how this HAS to go on your bucket list. There are no words or descriptions that can achieve the sense of beauty and emotion you feel there.\nThe tunnel view is absolutely breathtaking. The lower falls is a nice little hike but let this flatlander tell you....i live in Florida and am educated in elevation etc. No one can prepare you for the reality of what elevation does to you hiking up these mountains and paths. Just when you think you cant go any further because you are out of shape and trying to get oxygen, you look around and BOOM! You are at the end of the trail and viewing some of the most gorgeous sites you could ever see in your life. Waterfalls, valleys, overlooks...it is one of the very best places I have ever experienced.",

Lots of road construction (9/1/21) and the waits at the gate can be hard to sit through. Recommend getting to the gates not much after 8am  for a smooth entry.

We didn\u2019t get the lottery but heard sometimes people give up their passes at the half dome entrance. There were no passes when we got there but it was still an amazing hike. Take plenty of water if you are doing these hikes. Some get long. We did 14 miles going to the half dome entrance and back. It was still 2 more miles all up hill and back to do the half dome. Take rubber grip gloves too if you plan to do it. Visitor center area was great too. They have food and a store to buy souvenirs and snacks! Great experience here!",

There was way less people, and as long as you have the right cold gear, the experience can be just as wonderful. The amenities in the park were less favorable, there was no coin operated laundry and a lot of the shops were closed. But that's to be expected during the off season. Overall visiting Yosemite is just magical.",

I'm pregnant and without a lot of stamina at the moment but my two kids and husband and I had such an incredible time walking the Lower Falls Loop, the Cooke Meadow loop, and the Mariposa Grove Giant trail! They are all easy and very accessible to almost any ability level. Tips would be to get to the park EARLY (before 8) for parking and access to everything. Stay parked all day until you're ready to explore outside of the valley. Get on the shuttles near the parking lot stops because they will mostly empty there. Don't miss the Mariposa Grove big trees loop or the tunnel view! It's beautiful. The only suggestion I have for the park is to get more shuttles running. Waits can sometimes be very long (an hour or more).",

Maybe the only place with such spectacular waterfalls that are concentrated in a small area!\nWent in June 2023 and there were many many active waterfalls.\nParking is really problematic inside the park. A bunch of parking areas/lots are closed leaving limited parking spots throughout the park. Curry Village parking always fills up fast. Either plan to arrive early in the morning to get a spot at the parking areas near Curry Village or park someplace else and use the shuttle to commute between spots.\nHowever, note that shuttles may be full or be running delayed so prepare accordingly. Worst case you could be left waiting for a shuttle to arrive.",

There are easy hikes you can take to the extreme. Bring a bike, pack a picnic (highly suggested!) , or take the open tram ride  to have even more fun!! Easy to spend a whole day with the family!!",

Got a random bug to hike up to Yosemite point! Was able to go up and back in 4 hours.. Wow, if that wasn't a real hike.. Finished the day off eating a prime rib at Yosemite Ranch in Fresno.\nPacked alot into one day being the only day I had while out here for work, but wouldn't trade it for anything.

If they did, I could show you scrambling around the boulder field at the bottom of the lower Yosemite Falls.\n\nOr I could show the overpriced bike that I rented and how after it got stolen, I got lost trying to find my way back due to inadequate pedestrian infrastructure and signage (I can't imagine how hard it is for non-English speakers).\n\nAnd it's not just me getting lost, I got stopped by fellow visitors asking for directions more than a few times. Maybe this wouldn't be an issue if the park had consistent cell coverage and we could use map apps.\n\nI also take issue with how car dependent this park is. The busses are seasonal and only really exist in the valley. It's a similar story with bike access. For while there is 12+ miles of paved bike paths,  they are only in a portion of the valley and it feels like the park relegates cycling to an activity rather than a legitimate mode of transport.\n\nThe park deserves a major overhaul, especially given how expensive it is to go here.\nStill I really recommend this park, I really want to go back.",

A day is definitely not enough to explore the whole area, while every corner in this park is beautiful and worth exploring.\n\nNext time, I'd definitely going to stay at least a night and just enjoy the serenity in this place.",

Almost 95 percent of the park\u2019s 3,074 square kilometers (1,187 square miles) is classified as wilderness.\n\nDesignated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite National Park is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada, and the park supports a diversity of plants and animals.\n\nYosemite National Park contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine. Of California's 7,000 plant species, approximately 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20% are within Yosemite. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.\n\nThe expansive forests and a variety of rich habitats within Yosemite National Park hold over 400 animal species. Black bear, mule deer, foxes, and other mammals can be found throughout the Yosemite Valley. At higher elevations, the endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep can occasionally be spotted. Yosemite is also home to numerous bird populations, including California spotted owls or great gray owls.\n\nToday, about 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, including hikers, climbers, campers, bikers, photographers and nature lovers of all kinds, charmed by the park\u2019s awe-inspiring beauty and eager to experience one of America\u2019s greatest natural splendors.\n\nYosemite National Park offers an abundance of activities and sightseeing destinations. The Valley is a 18 square kilometers (7 square miles) wide canyon with incredible rock formations, including El Capitan, the world's tallest granite monolith and one of the world's top rock climbing destinations. Yosemite Falls is the largest waterfall in North America with breathtaking views. Peak visitation at the falls is in the spring as it is comprised entirely of melting snow. The park is also known for its Giant Sequoia trees, which are estimated to be over 3,000 years old.\n\nThe park set a visitation record in 2016, while the number of visitors surpassed five million for the first time in its history.\n\n* Some photos courtesy of Internet.

From breath taking views, to varying hikes, to white knuckle hair pin turn drive, this natural wonder is a must visit.\n\nDuring our visit (October 2021), the shuttles were NOT running.  That meant many of the locations required more driving to get around the park but also meant many areas you had to walk further because many passage areas were closed to vehicle traffic.\n\nIn the end, the park is a place of wonder, soul fulfilling, and beauty.  There is evidence of past fires but also evolving change to allow nature to grow back.  It is and will always be nature first but with and concerted effort balance access.\n\nVisit it, you will find some part that will put you in awe and wonder.",

This place is feast for your eyes and must visit place with family specially kids can enjoy but be careful with toddlers near to the falls. Spend at least one night here to see the milky way painted across the night sky. There are lot off points to watch and you can cover all the places with the help of map.

It\u2019s a place where no wifi connection exists, which in turn forces you to connect with Mother Nature. If you want to take it all in, I\u2019d suggest planning and staying several days inside the park, so plan wisely. The days I visited were quite pleasant, not too hot but not too cold (late May-early June). I did take my dog Duchess with me, which was quite lovely, but I\u2019d recommend leaving your pets at home to enjoy the adventures fully; there are several popular hikes where pets are not allowed, so something to think about. I did need to reserve my entry pass well in advance, which was suitable for three days. The park was not jammed packed with tourists, which was incredible for two things, 1. more available parking and 2. taking pictures without being photobombed. With covid restrictions being lifted, I won\u2019t be surprised if they allow more people in the park. I want to return and trek parts of the park where I could not go with my dog, like the half dome. Please visit this park if you want to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the city and if you are down to reconnect with mother nature at a another level. \u26f0\u2600\ufe0f\ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd7e\ud83e\udd7e\ud83e\udeb5\ud83c\udf33\ud83c\udf3e\ud83c\udf0a",

Spectacular views, granite walls that make you feel so small, and so much nature to bask in. Easily one of my favorite places ever. I was able to spend 4 days in the park in the fall/early winter and the colors were spectacular. Had some snowfall on one of the days which easily added to the beauty of the park. To be expected, the weekends were nearly doubled with people so I highly recommend getting to the park during a weekday to take in as much as you can without the crowds.",

If you\u2019re coming here from near or far, plan to camp for at least 3 days to get a glimpse of some of the nicest valleys, meadows and glacier tops. The hikes can be easy to difficult; choose wisely. Wear comfortable pair of shoes. There are restrooms at some of the prominent viewpoints. Bring your own food but keep it packed.

The traffic is as if you're downtown LA. The visitors drive very dangerously. They put themselves and everyone else in danger when they walk across the roads and stand in the roads. Outside the Valley they drive too fast and put wildlife in danger. It took me almost 20 minutes to find parking in Curry Village. I thought I was coming at a time when there would be less people (early October). I guess that's a national park for ya. It's overwhelming. John Muir is turning in his grave. #restoreyosemite",

Visitors who are not with a tour operator or private group, will need to arrange their own permits, reservations and fees.\nFor daytime adventurers, reservations are required and will cost $35 per non-commercial vehicle and $30 for motorcycles.\nIndividual entry hikers, bike riders and non-commercial bus or vans with more than 15 passenger seats are charged at $20.00 per person.\nCommercial operations should know to preplan accordingly. Otherwise, the group will be turned around and sent to the nearest shuttle bus stop.\nOnce inside, the Yosemite Valley is a large, open area to navigate freely. Exclusions apply for campsites and facilities used with private permits, as well as restricted park personnel areas.\nA note of caution is to be safe on rocky cliffs, protect the skin from excessive sun and watch out for the wildlife! Campers will need to prevent food scavenging bears from stealing their supplies with the use of lockboxes. The sturdy containers are usually included with permitted campsites.\nThe village is in sync with nature. Park facilities, cabins, shops and lodging, keep a natural appearance. Urban commercialism is obviously not acceptable here! The Village Store may not offer all the typical city supermarket stock, tho has a modest offering of essentials, so anyone can be a happy camper!\nLast but not least, there\u2019s been concern about a fire burning near the famous Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees. Kudos to the firefighters for holding their ground to protect the trees and to my colleague Mark for the updates!\nA park advisory has issued updates and information on the fires. It also mentions how preventative backfires have been used to minimize the ongoing danger.\nSo my hope is that wildfires will be stomped out with this footnote, as we take it all in stride!",

We were up before sunrise every day and saw a coyote, bobcat, two bears, and a bunch of deer in two days. The waterfalls look a little sad due to the drought, but it wouldn't stop me from going on all the hikes. We hiked up vernal falls, Taft point, sentinel dome, lower Yosemite falls, and glacier point.",

I was not even interested in going, but I was bored.\n\nIt is one of the most inspiring and breathtaking places that I have ever visited. These pictures do not show the grandiosity of these rocks and mountains. Luckily for me, the snow was melting producing a contrast between ice, waterfalls, and vegetation that was amazing. There were waterfalls everywhere and some were streaming down the rocks and into the river.\n\nNo drones are allowed, but using one would have been amazing.",

It is of Yosemite and all of my life I had been saying that I have to go to where this painting was inspired from. My long-awaited trip across Country van camping led me to Yosemite National Park. I can't believe I finally made it and it is amazing, breathtaking, awe inspiring. No painting, no picture and, no words can describe this Beauty accurately.",
